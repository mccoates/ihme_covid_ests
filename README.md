# ihme_covid_ests

Estimates folder contains downloaded versions of IHME COVID-19 estimates

PDF files contain data release information sheets from IHME

Folder names, which primarily consist of dates, are the folder names populated by IHME on download, 
though these dates do not always correspond to the date of release. For instance, the release on April 7, 2020
was named 2020_04_05.08.all

I am currently working on getting accurate dates for when these versions were live.
