Estimates folder contains downloaded versions of IHME COVID-19 estimates
https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections

PDF files contain data release information sheets from IHME

Folder names, which primarily consist of dates, are the folder names populated by IHME on download, 
though these dates do not always correspond to the date of release. For instance, the release on April 7, 2020
was named 2020_04_05.08.all

I am currently working on getting accurate dates for when these versions were live.


Note: Sometimes the datasets for download seem to be updated, but there are no differences between the versions. For instance, the version 2020_04_07.04.all, which was downloaded on April 8, 2020, had the exact same estimates as the dataset downloaded April 9, 2020, which was version 2020_04_07.06.all. The only difference was 14 decimal places deep in a single estimate. In cases like these, I have decided not to upload the new dataset.
